# Lib Guide

This directory contains the project’s lowest-level infrastructure modules.

Goals:
- Centralize shared infrastructure primitives (error model, HTTP wrappers, runtime init, web3 state).
- Keep cross-cutting behavior consistent across UI, hooks, and API layers.
- Keep this layer stable and hard to change by default.

## Directory Layout

```text
src/lib/
  abis/                    # Contract ABI files (reserved)
  common/
    errors/                # Base error model and domain errors
    web3/                  # Wagmi config and global EVM state store
  http/                    # HTTP, Next route response, React Query client wrappers
  runtime/                 # Global store/runtime initializers
  utils/                   # Pure utility helpers (formatter/json/shadcn helpers)
```

## Responsibilities

### `abis/`
- Stores contract ABI assets.
- Use this folder when adding/updating contract interface files.

### `common/errors/`
- Defines base error model (`BaseError`) and typed errors (request/EVM/internal).
- Provides global `errorStore` for unified client-side error handling.
- `BaseError.needFix` is used by HTTP response wrappers to distinguish fix-needed errors.

### `common/web3/`
- Defines `wagmiConfig` and wallet connector setup.
- Defines global EVM store (`evmStore`) and hooks (`useEvmStore`).
- Converts third-party wagmi/viem errors to project-level error classes.

### `http/`
- `ky.ts`: wrapped request helpers (`httpRequest`, `apiRequest`) with unified error conversion.
- `next.ts`: `withResponse` wrapper for Next.js route handlers (`src/app/api/**`).
- `react-query.ts`: project-level `queryClient` and query error bridge to `errorStore`.

### `runtime/`
- Initializes and wires global runtime behavior (`initializeEvmStore`, `initializeErrorStore`).
- Uses reference counting to prevent duplicated listeners/watchers.

### `utils/`
- Stores reusable pure utilities.
- Current groups:
  - `formatter/`: number/time/text and token amount formatting helpers (with tests).
  - `json/`: safe serialize/deserialize helpers.
  - `shadcn/`: `cn` helper for class composition and tailwind conflict merge.

## Modification Policy (Important)

By default, only `utils/` and `abis/` (abi-related assets) should be modified in normal feature work.

For other directories (`common/`, `http/`, `runtime/`):
- Treat them as foundational infrastructure.
- Do not modify unless there is a clear new business requirement that must change global behavior.
- Any change here should be minimal, explicit, and validated for cross-project impact.

## Usage Rules

1. API modules should request via `@/lib/http/ky` wrappers only.
2. Next.js route handlers should use `withResponse` for consistent success/error payloads.
3. Client API state should use the shared `queryClient` from `@/lib/http/react-query`.
4. Global runtime bootstrapping should be done through `runtime/` initializer functions.
5. Shared errors should prefer extending `BaseError` for consistent handling and transport.

## How To Add New Code In `lib`

### Add a utility (preferred common change)

1. Add module under `src/lib/utils/<group>/`.
2. Export from that group `index.ts` when applicable.
3. Add/update tests if logic is non-trivial (see `formatter/*.test.ts` pattern).
4. Use from upper layers (`api`, `hooks`, `ui`) through explicit imports.

### Add or update ABI

1. Add ABI file under `src/lib/abis/`.
2. Keep naming explicit and version-aware.
3. Use from API/web3 modules as needed.

### Change infrastructure modules (`common/http/runtime`)

1. Confirm there is a real cross-cutting requirement.
2. Keep scope minimal and backward-compatible where possible.
3. Verify impact on API routes, hooks, providers, and error handling flow.

## Design Principles

1. Infrastructure first: stable contracts over fast local hacks.
2. Single behavior source: one place for request, error, and runtime conventions.
3. Predictable failure handling: map external errors into typed internal errors.
4. Low churn core: avoid frequent changes in foundational folders.
5. Clear layering: business logic should stay in `api/hooks/ui`, not in `lib` core.

## Checklist For PRs

- Change is in `utils/` or `abis/` unless justified by new infra-level requirements.
- Request logic uses `httpRequest` / `apiRequest`, not ad-hoc transport code.
- Route handlers use `withResponse` for response consistency.
- Shared errors use `BaseError` hierarchy when appropriate.
- Utility changes include tests when behavior is complex or easy to regress.
