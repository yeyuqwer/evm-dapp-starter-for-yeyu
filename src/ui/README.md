# UI Guide

This directory contains page UI implementations and reusable UI modules.

Goals:
- Keep `src/app` as a thin route-entry layer.
- Keep real page implementation in `src/ui/app`.
- Keep reusable UI grouped by clear intent.

## Directory Layout

```text
src/ui/
  app/                      # UI implementation mapped to src/app routes
    layout/                 # Route-shared layout components (for example: header)
  components/
    providers/              # Providers and global handlers
    shared/                 # Generic shared components
    modal/                  # Modal components
  shadcn/                   # Installed shadcn components (usually do not modify)
  svgs/                     # SVG components
```

## Responsibilities

### `app/`
- Mirrors the route structure in `src/app`.
- Contains real page components used by route entries.
- Route entry component file uses `index.tsx`.
- Internal child component files should use kebab-case names, for example `server-config.tsx`.

### `app/layout/`
- Stores layout components shared by multiple route groups.
- Example: `header` is shared by both `(home)` and `examples`.
- Route-local layout components can also live under a specific route folder, for example `app/examples/layout/`.

### `components/providers/`
- Stores providers and global handlers.
- If more provider categories are needed later, create subdirectories and re-export from `index.ts`.

### `components/shared/`
- Stores normal reusable components when no stricter category is needed.

### `components/modal/`
- Stores modal-related components.

### `shadcn/`
- Stores installed shadcn UI components.
- Usually treat these as vendor-like primitives and avoid direct modification unless necessary.

### `svgs/`
- Stores SVG-based components.

## Mapping Rule: `src/app` <-> `src/ui/app`

Keep directory names aligned between route entries and page implementations.

```text
src/app/examples/server-time/page.tsx
src/ui/app/examples/server-time/index.tsx
```

This mapping makes route-to-UI lookup immediate.

## Naming Rules

1. Page route implementation entry file is `index.tsx` under `src/ui/app/**`.
2. Internal child component files use lowercase kebab-case naming.
3. Prefer explicit component names by role, such as `HomePage`, `ServerTimePage`, `ServerConfig`.

## Component Authoring Rules

Use this component declaration style in `src/ui`:

```tsx
export const Loader: FC<ComponentProps<'div'>> = () => {}
```

Rules:
- Except components in `svgs/`, do not pass or consume `props` and `className` by default.
- For non-`svgs/` components, keep the function parameter empty unless there is a clear project-level reason.
- If custom `props` or `className` behavior is needed, users should implement it explicitly in their own application layer.

## How To Add A New Page UI Module

1. Add route entry in `src/app/<route>/page.tsx`.
2. Add UI implementation in `src/ui/app/<route>/index.tsx`.
3. Keep route-to-UI folder mapping consistent.
4. Put route-local supporting components in the same folder using kebab-case filenames.
5. If a layout is shared only inside a route group (for example `examples`), create `layout/` inside that route folder.

## Design Principles

1. Route clarity: `src/app` is entry, `src/ui/app` is implementation.
2. Intent-based grouping: `providers`, `shared`, `modal`, `shadcn`, `svgs`.
3. Predictable search: mirrored folders and stable naming.
4. Reuse first: shared layout and shared components before duplication.
5. Keep primitives stable: avoid unnecessary edits in `shadcn/`.

## Checklist For PRs

- New route UI has `src/ui/app/**/index.tsx`.
- `src/app` and `src/ui/app` paths stay mirrored.
- Child component filenames follow kebab-case.
- Non-`svgs/` components do not introduce `props` or `className` by default.
- Shared or global concerns are placed in `components/providers` or `components/shared`.
- `shadcn` files are changed only when there is a clear reason.
